## 📁 Project Versions

### 1. [HTML, CSS & JavaScript Version](./html-css-js-version)
A lightweight, no-framework version using just the basics. Great for understanding the core logic and structure behind a rating scale.

- Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Run it by opening `index.html` in your browser.

### 2. [React & Tailwind CSS Version](./react-tailwind-version)
A modern version using React for component-based structure and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

- Technologies: React, Tailwind CSS, Vite (or Create React App)
- Run it with:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
## 🤖 Built with Bolt

The React + Tailwind CSS version of this project was built **entirely using [Bolt](https://bolt.ai)** — an AI agent for software development. No manual coding, just conversations and instructions.

Bolt handled:

- Scaffolding the React project
- Writing reusable components
- Styling with Tailwind
- Setting up interaction logic
- Even the README content (you're reading it 👀)

This showcases the power of modern dev tools — both human and AI — working together.
